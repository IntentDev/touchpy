# TouchPy
TouchPy is a high-performance toolset to work with TouchDesigner components in Python.

By leveraging Vulkan, CUDA, and TouchEngine, TouchPy opens new pathways for integration, particularly with libraries such as PyTorch and Nvidia Warp. TouchPy supports GPU-to-GPU (zero-copy) data transfers, streamlining data exchange between standalone Python applications and Touchdesigner.

Please refer to the project [Documentation](https://intentdev.github.io/touchpy/) for installation instructions, API and language reference.

More usage examples and tutorials are coming soon.
