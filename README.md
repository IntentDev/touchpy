# TouchPy
TouchPy is a framework for high-performance integration of TouchDesigner in a stand-alone Python environment.

By leveraging Vulkan, CUDA, and TouchEngine, TouchPy opens new pathways for integration, particularly with libraries such as PyTorch and Nvidia Warp. TouchPy supports GPU-to-GPU (zero-copy) data transfers, streamlining data exchange between standalone Python applications and Touchdesigner.

Please refer to the project [Documentation](https://intentdev.github.io/touchpy/) for installation instructions, API and language reference.
