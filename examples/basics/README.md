# TouchPy Basic Examples

This folder contains basic examples of how to use TouchPy, with relatively thorough explanations of the concepts and tools. Each example focuses on a particular aspect of interfacing with the library. 

## Dependencies
Currently only two examples have dependencies other than TouchPy, 02_chops.py (NumPy) and 06_tops.py (PyTorch). 

`pip install numpy`

Follow instructions from https://pytorch.org/ to install PyTorch for your system. Typically something like:

`pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118`

## Jurigged
Installing Jurigged is also useful for experimenation providing the ability to update code while it's running.

`pip install jurigged`

Then run in terminal:

`jurigged 01_load_comp_basic.py`
